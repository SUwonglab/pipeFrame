Description: pipeFrame is an R package for building comonentized bioinformatics pipeline. 
    Each step in the pipeline is wrapped by the framework so connection among steps become seamless and easy.
    Pipeline user can focus on arguments tuning rather than spending a lot of time on file format transfomation,
    passing result directory from output to input and installing the depedent data and software. 
    Componontized step elements are also able to customized into new pipeline flexibly. 
    Componontized pipeline can restart at the breakpoint and avoid reruning the whole pipeline 
    when there is any kind of interruption.
